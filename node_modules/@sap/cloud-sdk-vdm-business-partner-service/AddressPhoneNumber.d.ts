A normalized form of the telephone number or fax number is then derived and stored in a field for a program-driven search.In most cases, the telephone number or fax number refers directly to an address.If this is the case, when a new number is created, the country of the address is proposed.If this is not the case (for example, with address-independent communication data for a business partner), the country from the user parameter LND is proposed (if it is maintained). If the user parameter LND is not maintained, the country of the company address assigned in the user master data is proposed.If the country of the address changes, the country of the corresponding telephone number and fax address is not changed automatically.Example: A business partner moves abroad.If the telephone number is for a permanent connection, the telephone number also changes when the business partner moves and has to be maintained again in the system.If the telephone number is for a mobile telephone and the number is retained, the original country for this telephone number also has to be retained and must not be changed automatically to the new country of the address.

     * If several addresses are maintained for one communication type, the user in the SAP System can be reached under one of these addresses. One address can be set as theStandard Address.
     * The standard address is used for the following functions:When sending using the  SMTP nodein SAPconnect, the home address of the communication type used is the one set as the sender address. The recipient can see this address in the sender information and can also reply directly to this address. The standard address is also transferred and can be used for incoming status notifications, for example.When sending using an RFC node in SAPconnect, the standard address of the communication type used is the one set as the sender address. The structure defined in the case of the RFC does not permit another address to be transferred, so the standard address is used for incoming status notifications too.The SAP users have the addresses of their exchange P.O. boxes in their standard communication type &apos;Internet Mail&apos; as the home address and their Internet address in the SAP system as their standard address. Example:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type &apos;Internet Mail&apos; (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type &apos;Internet Mail&apos; (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address, it arrives back to the SAP system.Example using a mail system groupThe users should get all messages in their Microsoft Exchange postboxes. In the SAP system the mail system group is activated for this using the setting &quot;Send Messages to the Home Address&quot;.The address settings of the SAP users remain unchanged:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type &apos;Internet Mail&apos; (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address the user receives directly in the exchange postbox.Sending using the RFC nodeThe standard address of the communication type &apos;Internet Mail&apos; (Bernard.Brown@System.Company.com) is used as the sender address. If a reply is sent to this address it arrives back in the SAP system. It is then forwarded using the mail system group to the home address and the user gets it in the exchange postbox.
