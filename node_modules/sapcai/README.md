# SAP Conversational AI - SDK Node.js
SAP Conversational AI official SDK in Node.js

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap/) [API](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/api-reference) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-NodeJS/wiki/Analyse-text)
* [Manage your conversation](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-NodeJS/wiki/Manage-your-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-NodeJS/wiki/Receive-and-send-messages)

## Installation

Install the package using npm, as shown below:
```bash
npm install --save sapcai
```

You can now use the SDK in your code. All you need is your bot's token. In case you have enabled our versioning feature in the settings of your bot, you can refer to our [versioning documentation](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning) to learn how to select the appropriate token for you versions and environments.

_Note:_ The `train` API needs to be initialized with the bot version. If versioning is not enabled for the bot, the default `v1` should be used. For more info see our documentation on [versioning](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning).

#### ES5

Using the entire SDK:
```js
var sapcai = require('sapcai').default

var client = new sapcai('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

Extracting one single API:
```js
var sapcai = require('sapcai').default

var converse = new sapcai.converse('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

#### ES6

Using the entire SDK:
```js
import sapcai from 'sapcai'

const client = new sapcai('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

Extracting one single API:
```js
import { converse } from 'sapcai'

const clientConverse = new converse('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

## Sample projects
